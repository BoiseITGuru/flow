*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*

- Sev-2 Incident: Public Access nodes went down between 5:20 pm to 6:00 pm on Wednesday 9/13
     - Root cause: ANs were not started after a hardware upgrade by the AN operator
     - Fix: Auto-restart has since been added; More observability on the ANs will be added soon.
